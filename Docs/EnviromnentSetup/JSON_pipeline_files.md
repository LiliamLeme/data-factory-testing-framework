# Data Factory - Testing Framework

## JSON Files

This is also a piece of extra information you case you need more details on how to get the JSON Files from ADF, Synapse, or Fabric to proceed with the testing. Again this is an extra step in case you find it challenging to find this information, if you do not need or if you already have this information from your repository. Feel free to skip.

### Step by Step 

Here we will follow step by step for each option mentioned before:

#### Fabric

You can open and save the JSON file that you will use for your pipeline from the designer for Pipeline.
